# deepLearning-project-srcnn

You need to run the code step by step from top to bottom.
This project is a group project. It was done by Xinyue Zhang, Taha Mousavi and Yuebo Yao.
Xinyue Zhang and Taha Mousavi were responsible for coding the experimental study between the Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network and the bicubic interpolation. 
Yuebo Yao was responsible for analyzing the experimental results and finding both algorithms' differences.
